description: Quickly create a tree using Mash distances
introduction: |
  The `mashtree` module uses [Mashtree](https://github.com/lskatz/mashtree) to create a tree of your samples
  using [Mash](https://github.com/marbl/Mash) distance. You can use use `--species` or `-accessions` to to
  see how your samples compare to completed genomes. If used, 
  [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download) will download available completed 
  genomes available from RefSeq and they will be included in your tree.
