description: Quickly download assemblies from NCBI's Assembly database
introduction: |
  The `ncbi-genome-download` module uses [ncbi-genome-download](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download) to 
  download genomes from NCBI Assembly database. This allows you to easily supplement your analyses with 
  publicly available genomes.
