    description: >-
      A braseqtb Tool which uses Bakta to rapidly provide extensive annotations (tRNA, tmRNA,
      rRNA, ncRNA, CRISPR, CDS, pseudogenes, and sORFs) in a standardized fashion.
  introduction: |
    The `bakta` module uses [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta) to rapidly annotate bacterial 
    genomes and plasmids in a standardized fashion. Bakta makes use of a large database ([40+ GB](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4247252))
    to provide extensive annotations including: tRNA, tmRNA, rRNA, ncRNA, CRISPR, CDS, and sORFs.
