#NOTE: Not natively. Python 2.7 was sunsetted prior to release of the osx-arm64 platform, so there isn't any such build. One could try requesting such a build on the Conda Forge Python feedstock, but even if someone did that you'd still face the issue that most Python packages will also lack osx-arm64 builds for Python 2.7.
#Emulate through Rosetta. Apple provides an x86_64 emulator, Rosetta 2, which will run x86_64 binaries, such as what would be installed with Conda environments using an osx-64 subdir. One can create environments with such a subdir setting with something like:
#CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create -n py27 python=2.7  # include other packages here
# ensure that future package installs in this env stick to 'osx-64'
#conda activate py27
#conda config --env --set subdir osx-64
